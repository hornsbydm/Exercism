Rob Pike's Go Proverbs
----------------------
- Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating.
- Concurrency is not parallelism.
- Channels orchestrate; mutexes serialize.
- The bigger the interface, the weaker the abstraction.
- Make the zero value useful.
- interface{} says nothing.
- gofmt's style is no one's favourite, yet gofmt is everyone's favourite.
- A little copying is better than a little dependency.
- Syscall must always be guarded with build tags.
- Cgo must always be guarded with build tags.
- Cgo is not Go.
- With the unsafe package there are no guarantees.
- Clear is better than clever.
- Reflection is never clear.
- Errors are just values.
- Don't just check errors, handle them gracefully.
- Design the architecture, name the components, document the details.
- Documentation is for users.
- Don't panic.
